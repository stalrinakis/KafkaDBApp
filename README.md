Java servlet (TestServ) that handles HTTP GET requests to fetch and process Reddit posts. 

Functionalities:

Fetches Reddit posts based on user-specified parameters (number of posts, time created, sort option, subreddit, and keywords).
Converts the fetched posts to Avro format and uploads them to HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System).
Runs a MapReduce job (KeywordsRunner) to process the uploaded data.
Attempts to run a K-means clustering algorithm on the post data.
Converts the processed Avro data back to Post objects.
Creates a JSON response containing the processed post data and sends it back to the client.
Includes methods for interacting with Kafka, though these appear to be unused in the main flow.
Handles various exceptions and error cases, including rate limiting from the Reddit API.

The servlet integrates several big data technologies and APIs, including Hadoop, Avro, Kafka, and the Reddit API, to fetch, process, and analyze Reddit post data. It seems to be part of a larger system for analyzing Reddit content, possibly for trend analysis or content categorization.
